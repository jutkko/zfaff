# Zhou's Family and Friends Fund
As soon as I started to really think about investments, I realised that this is going to a 
lifetime effort. Lucky me, I got good financial support from my lovely parents. I was able
to go to college and graduate with a decent degree. Some small stories before we get to more
details of this fund.

There was almost 0 month when I spent all my salary. So I could save up some cash during the first
few years of my career. However I did not know what to do with it. I vaguely know that it's no
good to hold them as cash. The first ever stock I bought was ARM. I spent 200 pounds to exchange
some "virtual" shares of a company that I did not know what it does. Again being lucky ARM was taken
private by SoftBank and my shared grew in price! I made 40 pounds. I did not know what I
was doing. 

Almost during the same time after starting my first job, I was told that I received some options. 
This was a hard topic for me again. Somehow in my mind I always thought they will be at some
piont valuable. And hence I purchased all the options I could when I left my first company. 
2 years later it went public and then taken private. My shares grew by almost 80% and I was force to
cash out. I did not know what I was doing.

In 2020, a good friend of mine recommended me a book by [Li Lu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Lu)
called Civilization, Modernization, Value Investing and China. I was blown away by the book's
intelectual richness in reasoning why the world runs like it does and why we're so lucky to be alive
in this era. I began to think about what's long-term, and how compounding can make substantial 
difference even with [small starting points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jKR0gPf5YsTZIIwL-7niXdK0htSfz6p_kGFm7EZXO3g/edit?usp=sharing).
2020 summer, I bagen investing again. This time for each company equity I purchase, I'll try
my best to learn, feel and reason what does the future hold for it. Is it the global movement
to an electric future? Is it the explosion of new and young innovations from Chinese IT companies?
Or is it the new way we spend, transfer and exchange money?

Perhaps the most important question here is, do I know what I am doing? Well let's take the next 10-15
years to find out! Would you join me? 

## What is this?
This is fund runs like a DAF (Donor-Advised Fund). When a doner decides to donate and makes a 
donation, they agree that the fund will then take over the donation and convert it into investment
assets. The strategy and execution are managed by me.

When the investments make profit, once a year, the fund will decide to contribute what portion
of the profit to do the below activities. Again once a year, all the donors will be given
the options to decide what to do with their portion of the profit (free of charge)
1. Withdraw, once receiving the profit, the donors decide how to spend the money on any charity
or any activities they think is good. I trust everyone to act in good faith.
1. Not withdraw, vote on a list to decide which charity institutions to contribute the funds to.
List curated by me.
1. Not withdraw, nothing happens.
1. Leave the decision to me.

I would like to have this fund to run for many centuries, like the
[Nobel Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Foundation).

## What is the strategy
Provided the complex and volatile movements of the market, I focus on the companies' development
for the next 5-10 years. I focus on good leadership in companies which I believe will deliver
consistent reasonable decision making and stable execution. The investments this fund makes will
likely fall into (not limited to)

1. The transition to an electric future. This can be broken down to
  1. Electic vehicles and automous driving
  1. Power storage and power generation from the sun
  1. Electricity consumption growing by a factor of 10
1. Companies who benefit from the booming of China, a more integrated with the whole world China.
1. Next-gen payment system in the world, paying peers, internation transfers and foreign exchange.

I will hold each investment for at least few years, if possible I will continue investing and
hold for longer. For now, the majority of the investment should go into equity market.
