# Zhou's Family and Friends Fund
As soon as I started to really think about investments, I realised that this is going to a 
lifetime effort. Lucky me, I got good financial support from my lovely parents. I was able
to go to college and graduate with a decent degree. Some small stories before we get to the
goal of this fund.

There was almost 0 month when I spent all my salary. So I could save up some cash during the first
few years of my career. However I did not know what to do with it. I vaguely know that it's no
good to hold them as cash. The first ever stock I bought was ARM. I spent 200 pounds to exchange
some "virtual" shares of a company that I did not know what it does. Again being lucky ARM was taken
private by SoftBank and my shared grew in price! I made roughly 40 pounds. I did not know what I
was doing. 

Almost during the same time after starting my first job, I was told that I received some options. 
This was a hard topic for me again. Somehow in my mind I always thought they will be at some
piont valuable. And hence I purchased all the options I could when I left my first company. 
2 years later it went public and then taken private. My shares grew by almost 80%. I did not know
what I was doing.

In 2020, a good friend of mine recommended me a book by [Li Lu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Lu) called
Civilization, Modernization, Value Investing and China. I began to think about what's long-term, and
how compounding can make substantial difference even with [small starting points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jKR0gPf5YsTZIIwL-7niXdK0htSfz6p_kGFm7EZXO3g/edit?usp=sharing). 
For each company equity I purchase, I'll try my best to learn, feel and reason what does the
future hold for it. Is it the global movement to electric future? Is it the explosion of new
and young innovations from Chinese IT companies? Or is it the new way we spend, transfer and
exchange money? Perhaps the most important question here is, do I know what I am doing? Well
let's take the next 10-15 years to find out! Would you join me?
