# TSLA
I try to organise this section so one can find all the sources I use to build a
high conviction for Tesla.

## Steven Mark Ryan
On of my most watched channel. Very strange but eye catching colour scheme for
his video covers. I first came across Steven Mark Ryan when trying to find out
if Tesla was a legit company. If you want to understand what he's saying, you
might need to first watch some of the very old videos of his. I recommend to watch
[this](https://youtu.be/OYe8EC8ywWM) to get a feeling how he continues to invest
even when there is 0 gain or even negative profit for long periods of time.

Perhaps I am watching Steven a bit too much lol.
