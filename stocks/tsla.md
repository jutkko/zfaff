# TSLA
Since mid 2020, I spent more than 500 hours on learning about Tesla. This will 
increase in the coming months and years. In order to have a more organised approach
for getting the information, I will organise it a bit. Below is an incomplete list
of sources I use to build a high conviction for Tesla.

## Steven Mark Ryan
On of my most watched channel. Very strange but eye catching colour scheme for
his video covers. I first came across Steven Mark Ryan when trying to find out
if Tesla was a legit company. If you want to understand what he's saying, you
might need to first watch some of the very old videos of his. I recommend to watch
[this](https://youtu.be/OYe8EC8ywWM) to get a feeling how he continues to invest
even when there is 0 gain or even negative profit for long periods of time.

Perhaps I am watching Steven a bit too much lol.

## Rob Mauer
Calm, soothing and friendly voice of Rob's is a good way to start your day (CST).
Rob is a very objective and logical Tesla investor. A good escape from being too
optimistic about the company's short term growth.
