# TSLA
Since mid 2020, I spent more than 500 hours on learning about Tesla. This will 
increase in the coming months and years. In order to keep the entropy of the information
relatively low, I will organise it a bit. Below is an incomplete list
of sources I use to build a high conviction for Tesla.

## Dave
I liked this [video](https://youtu.be/dPQKku2_Lvg) from Dave. Not only he's an
investor, he goes out and talks about how he can help others. In fact this video
made me really think how a small amount can have an outsized impact on others lives.

Dave is an excellent investor, he conducts interviews with other Tesla investors
online. Sometimes he makes [interesting observations](https://twitter.com/heydave7/status/1460011655002271747?s=20)
about small but important details.

To get an idea of compounding, check this video out from Dave, [the power of 72](https://youtu.be/nkOApFCFrOk).

Did I say he is [funny](https://twitter.com/heydave7/status/1462657208399929347?s=20)?

Author of the best public articles written for Tesla stock. Logical and rigorous

of this [masterpiece](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/05/my-tsla-investment-strategy.html).

## Steven Mark Ryan (Rated PG)
One of my most watched channel. Very strange but eye catching colour scheme for
his video covers. I first came across Steven Mark Ryan when trying to find out
if Tesla was a legit company. If you want to understand what he's saying, you
might need to first watch some of the very old videos of his. I recommend to watch
[this](https://youtu.be/OYe8EC8ywWM) to get a feeling how he continues to invest
even when there is 0 gain or even negative profit for long periods of time.

Perhaps I am watching Steven a bit too much lol.

## Rob Mauer
Calm, soothing and friendly voice of Rob's is a good way to start your day (CST).
Rob is a very objective and logical Tesla investor. A good escape from being too
optimistic about the company's short term growth.
