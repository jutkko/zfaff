一周年了。

## 今年都发生了啥
我认为即使是在二十年三十年后，回看今年都会是相当奇怪的一年。俄乌战争导致的一系列宏观经济问题，新冠疫情和后新冠疫情带来的雪上加霜效应，我们可以用一个字来形容今年的环境，那就是十分的混乱。

### 美国政策
美国年基准利率从几乎为负到 4%，全球都跟上这个节奏。让投资者对高增长的公司变得谨慎，我们持有的几乎所有公司都属于高增长，所以在这个上面我们的表现惨烈。

### 国内政策
国内的动态清零，不同的政策从不同角度对经济的影响也很大，我们持有的几乎所有公司也是和中国有千丝万缕的联系。

### 欧洲的能源问题
按理说能源危机会对新能源的企业有一些正面的帮助，可是能源危机更直接导致生活成本上升，大家对投资和消费变得小心翼翼，欧洲人都要被冻死了。

## 股票和几个重点公司做了啥
### 股票价格
用一句很简单的话形容今年：没有最低，只有更低。我们拿特斯拉来看，历史新高和两年最低都发生在今年。腰斩，斩到剩下脚踝了。

### 公司表现
总体来说我们关注的公司表现都还可以，我没有去增加或者减少原来买的公司股票。从股票价格来看，今年对我的心里反复折磨。从长远来看，我更希望是正好去拿今年的经历过程去看什么是 timing the market vs. time in the market 区别。大家都是会说，是不是真的能去切身经历并且做到呢？

## 接下来我应该会怎么做
我们玩的是长远的游戏，接下来方向很简单。继续关注新能源公司，中国具有国际潜力的互联网公司，电子支付。

## 对于第一波做好事的思考
今年的重点是活下去，并且亏损的业绩表现也不允许我们去筹钱。不过我倒是零零散散的收集了几个好的点子，以备以后之需。

- 捐赠 Starlink 去贫穷没有网络的地方
- Khan Academy

## 💤 Being lazy about updates

It's been a while since my last update. But that doesn't mean I wasn't doing much! I cannot
emphasise enough that the past 3 months have been crazy! I have been mainly focusing on getting
TSLA shares for a cheaper price. The fluctuation of the common stock price was large, from
$1200+ to almost less than $700, not to mention at points it was cheaper than my average holding
price. It was a rare opportunity to be able to harvest some TSLA shares. For the first time, I
bought a 2024 option call on margin.

The macro environment for the market hasn't been great, with the investors expecting the interest
rate going up, outbreak of war between Ukraine and Russia and continued uncertainty in HKEX for
Chinese local companies.

However I don't think the fundamentals has changed at all for any of the companies I hold. Which
means, had I had more capital to allocate, I would continue to buy.

从洗澡时想到去跑一个公益基金的想法涌现到现在差不多过去一个多月。我终于把大家的投捐款全部整理完毕。先讲结论，这次收集到超过二十多位同学的共 30843 美金（包括我自己的 10000 美金）。吹个牛，我们这里的投捐者里面既有管理上亿美金资产的基金管理人，也有入不敷出没有收入的无业游民，谢谢大家的看好。这个过程在大家鼎力支持下总体顺利，但也碰到了一些困难。首当其冲当然是本基金备受质疑的出发点，自己不赚钱又不圈钱到底在做什么。

## 长线的价值投资

我相信投资的康庄大道就是长线的价值投资。我设想如果有一个平台能让我和亲朋好友们一起学习那就更好不过了。希望你们也觉得有用，这对我来说意义非凡。

## 做好事

我们中间有好几位伙伴是奔着做好事来的。我有很多需要向你们学习的地方，当然我有信心把这方面做好哈哈。在 2022 年底我们会开启第一次做好事活动。

写在 Elon Musk 成为时代周刊年度人物之际，写在自己中招 Covid 之际，写在基金启动之际。

## 🤑 Renting out a Tesla (¥9k/month)

I ordered a drive to airport service getting to the PVG Ariport. The driver arrived early and
was playing games downstairs while waitng for me. So I thought he should be well rested to
get me to the destination. However when I woke up from a nap in the car, I realised he was
not only driving slowly but also not carefully (sweviing around). So I decided to have a
chat with him to wake him up and keep myself save lol. 

First we talked about what  my rent was and he deduced how much I was making 
per month at least. Afer some random nonsense, when I asked him if he considered to drive
a Model 3 for the service since I thought it make him more money. Surprisingly he told me that
he had a Model S! At first I thought, oh this guy's hobby is to drive and he is just driving me
around for fun. Then I learnt that he is using the car to do business. It's a 2015 car and it's
got lifetime warranty on battery and the electic motors, plus [unlimited supercharging](https://electrek.co/2021/07/21/how-to-tell-if-your-tesla-qualifies-for-free-supercharging/#h-does-tesla-still-offer-free-supercharging).

As smart as Chinese people are, what's the best way to leverage and exploit this guarantee? 
Rent it out! Since he asked for my rent so I was curious about how much he made from
doing so. The car rents for $9k a month. Damn!

Let's do some quick maths here. The car was bought by this guy for around ¥400k, this would
give him annual return of whopping `12*9k / 400k = 27%`. And the car doesn't need much
service since the key components are covered by Tesla. Of course there is depreciation and all
that, but I think the investment still makes some sense.

This was an intriguing chat of course, but how I should I feel as a Tesla investor 🤔? Anyway
I should end this note with, EVs are going to rock the world!

## 🔪 Chinese Stocks (BILI, Nio)
I believe this is going to be a rough period for Chinese companies listed in the US
or Hong Kong. That being said, it's actually not **that** bad for many newer companies.
Take BILI or Nio for example, the prices have merely come down to what it was mid last
year. So who said things go up all the time?

I had felt that 38-40 USD price range was fair for Nio this time last year. And it turns
out to be correct! Next time I should write the predictions down.

## 🍗 Beyong Meat
Discovered that Beyond Meat's CEO was forced to step down. Panic mode. Beyond
takes <1% of the portfolio today, but it was much larger earlier. Not plannig to
sell right now, but will keep a close eye on this company.

## 🇨🇳 BABA
Alibaba keeps dropping. Next step is to focus and learn more about the fundamentals
of the company and decide if should invest more to persist the percentage of 
the portfolio.
