## ü§ë Renting out a Tesla (¬•9k/month)

I ordered a drive to airport service getting to the PVG Ariport. The driver arrived early and
was playing games downstairs while waitng for me. So I thought he should be well rested to
get me to the destination. However when I woke up from a nap in the car, I realised he was
not only driving slowly but also not carefully (sweviing around). So I decided to have a
chat with him to wake him up and keep myself save lol. 

First we talked about what  my rent was and he deduced how much I was making 
per month at least. Afer some random nonsense, when I asked him if he considered to drive
a Model 3 for the service since I thought it make him more money. Surprisingly he told me that
he had a Model S! At first I thought, oh this guy's hobby is to drive and he is just driving me
around for fun. Then I learnt that he is using the car to do business. It's a 2015 car and it's
got lifetime warranty on battery and the electic motors, plus [unlimited supercharging](https://electrek.co/2021/07/21/how-to-tell-if-your-tesla-qualifies-for-free-supercharging/#h-does-tesla-still-offer-free-supercharging).

As smart as Chinese people are, what's the best way to leverage and exploit this guarantee? 
Rent it out! Since he asked for my rent so I was curious about how much he made from
doing so. The car rents for $9k a month. Damn!

Let's do some quick maths here. The car was bought by this guy for around ¬•400k, this would
give him annual return of whopping `12*9k / 400k = 27%`. And the car doesn't need much
service since the key components are covered by Tesla. Of course there is depreciation and all
that, but I think the investment still makes some sense.

This was an intriguing chat of course, but how I should I feel as a Tesla investor ü§î? Anyway
I should end this note with, EVs are going to rock the world!

## üî™ Chinese Stocks (BILI, Nio)
I believe this is going to be a rough period for Chinese companies listed in the US
or Hong Kong. That being said, it's actually not **that** bad for many newer companies.
Take BILI or Nio for example, the prices have merely come down to what it was mid last
year. So who said things go up all the time?

I had felt that 38-40 USD price range was fair for Nio this time last year. And it turns
out to be correct! Next time I should write the predictions down.

## üçó Beyong Meat
Discovered that Beyond Meat's CEO was forced to step down. Panic mode. Beyond
takes <1% of the portfolio today, but it was much larger earlier. Not plannig to
sell right now, but will keep a close eye on this company.

## üá®üá≥ BABA
Alibaba keeps dropping. Next step is to focus and learn more about the fundamentals
of the company and decide if should invest more to persist the percentage of 
the portfolio.
