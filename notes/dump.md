## Chinese Stocks (BILI, Nio)
I believe this is going to be a rough period for Chinese companies listed in the US
or Hong Kong. That being said, it's actually not **that** bad for many newer companies.
Take BILI or Nio for example, the prices have merely come down to what it was mid last
year. So who said things go up all the time?

I had felt that 38-40 USD price range was fair for Nio this time last year. And it turns
out to be correct! Next time I should write the predictions down.

## Beyong Meat
Discovered that Beyond Meat's CEO was forced to step down. Panic mode. Beyond
takes <1% of the portfolio today, but it was much larger earlier. Not plannig to
sell right now, but will keep a close eye on this company.

## BABA
Alibaba keeps dropping. Next step is to focus and learn more about the fundamentals
of the company and decide if should invest more to persist the percentage of 
the portfolio.
