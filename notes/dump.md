## Beyong Meat
Discovered that Beyond Meat's CEO was forced to step down. Panic mode. Beyond
takes <1% of the portfolio today, but it was much larger earlier. Not plannig to
sell right now, but will keep a close eye on this company.

## BABA
Alibaba keeps dropping. Next step is to focus and learn more about the fundamentals
of the company and decide if should invest more to persist the percentage of 
the portfolio.
